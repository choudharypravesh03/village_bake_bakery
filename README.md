# village_bake_bakery
Say hello to Toronto Dreams, a static website for a bakery. Took things in a slightly different direction with this one, partly to mess with CSS grid (which this one relies on pretty heavily) but mostly to get back to making weirder and more experimental designs/layouts. Anyway, hope you dig it, and thanks for the continued support despite the lack of updates :)
